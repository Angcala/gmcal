# GMCal
Calendar and Schedule tooling for GMs

GMCal will help you to organize your game sessions with your players.

## Current State
GMCal is currently available as a CLI, with code written to be used as the backend for an eventual web-based UI

This is a work in progress, and functionality will continue to expand and be refined.

Checkout [TODO](TODO.md) for the roadmap!

Checkout `python main.py --help` for help and available methods

## What can it do?
GMCal allows users to create a session with a proposed time and a list of attendees. 
Those attendees can then respond (currently manually) and those responses can be recorded with the CLI. Responses can include proposals for new times if the existing one doesn't work.
The session creator can then list the responses to their session to see if a common time was found.
